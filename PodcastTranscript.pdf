Hello, my name is Bella and this is my first podcast episode for media writing. 


Today I’m discussing wordplay within Machine Gun Kelly’s music. For a while, Machine Gun Kelly has been one of my favorite artists of all time. I adore his music. I think he’s a lyrical genius. 


He has so many songs that just touched me in so many ways and I have created memories with me and my friends from home and from school here I just, truly think he is one of the best artists out there. 


So I want to discuss those and some specific words within them so first he uses a lot of complex rhymes on this a lot of complex schemes that a lot of rappers use specifically Eminem and uses a lot of internal rhymes that have a complexity meaning like the rhymes have multiple layers to them. 


Meaning multiple things, he also uses a lot of puns and entendres he incorporates many since his lyrics have multiple layers to his songs.


He allows a listeners to interpret them in different ways and he really does what your perspective of the song is, and I think that’s my favorite thing about his music , he uses metaphor uses similes uses a lot of literary devices to draw comparisons not only like vivid and imagery, but also surprising and things that you might not expect and uses them to paint that like detailed picture of the emotions and situations he is describing of the memories and experiences, he went through alot a lot of trauma and hes really gone through that heavily within his music and I think he is able to channel it so well his music and tell such beautiful stories and such beautiful ways without just saying it. 


He also uses alliterations a lot. He does a lot of lyrics that make it really catchy to the ear, which is why I think it’s also so effective because not only is telling amazing stories also so catchy people remembered so well. So one of the first songs that I thought of and also found online that was a good example was “Bad Things” released in 2016 he did with Camila Cabello this song he used a lot of metaphors. He tried to describe this complex, romantic relationship. 


He was going through with this girl and he says I’m out of my head and out of my head if you only knew about things I like that I cant explain. I say it’s complicated and he uses a lot of head and mind and words that rhyme with repetition to kind of attract that theme of the bad things and I think he’s trying to attract that theme of the bad things and I think he’s trying to tap into the emotional depth while also creating like a lyrical, lyrically catchy song. 


Another one of my favorite songs by him is “Bloody Valentine” and he’s able to really highlight this complex relationship as well, where he uses, a contrast between the fake love of the relationship, but also it may not be that healthy of a relationship although they’re so in love and I think he also compares the memories of this relationship to handprints in cement, suggesting that this impact of the relationship is so long and it just can never be undone and it’s so permanent and so permanently traumatizing, he says my dreams are silk screens, this metaphor I think it is so kind of fitting for this because the silk screens like using for printing is his bad dreams and thoughts and experiences that he has gone through our printed images on his brain and without those images without those printed.


The last one I was thinking of was the entire album itself, but also his song “Title Track” in his album, Tickets to my Downfall his third album refers to the album and the struggles like a downfall and everyone there watching him is watching his downfall like a show. 




I think it’s so interesting because he is able to say like I see my friends in the front row and he talks about how he sees those people he cares about him and I think it’s not that one but I think critiquing himself about how he has self-awareness and he knows that a lot of people around him or out to get him and he knows people don’t like him but he still but he still createS his music and still wants to share that depth and that emotional pain. Yeah.. I believe he has so many different types of metaphors and analogies.


I mean this was just some of the ones I had found and I thought of my head because hundreds of songs now and like I just think his music has such a impact on his community. Thank You.
